This is the new speed reader test for kids!
===========================================

A. This repository is stored on google:
https://source.developers.google.com/p/lynleser-no/r/default

B: Users can be administered through the IAM pane in the google cloud console.
The owner of the project is the intertext.no user.
User fales.tom.1994@gmail.com and orstavik77@gmail.com is added as editors.

C. To authenticate us from the computer we commit code from, we need to use the gcloud sdk tool.
gcloud init

D. To use this repository, we must use git. 
Git can be used directly from atom. Or from cmd line.

Git
===
1. First you make sure the file is added to git. Git add makes the file "watched" by git.
2. All changes made to the file are not versioned ("saved") in git before they are commited. Every time you git commit something it gets a new version number.
3. But you dont push any data from your computer to the git server before you do a git push.

So to add a line in a new file, you must do all 3 steps.
So to add a line to a file already watchedd by git, you must make 2 steps.

This is my basic knowledge of Git.
